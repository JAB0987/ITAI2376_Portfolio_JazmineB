##  Highlights

- Built deep learning models using **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, and **Keras**
- Explored advanced topics like **Transformers**, **NLP**, and **Diffusion Models**
- Applied theoretical concepts in practical labs and creative assignments
- Gained experience with debugging, model evaluation, and optimization techniques
